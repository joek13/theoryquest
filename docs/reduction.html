            <p>"First," Bruno thinks to himself, I need to take care of these noodles. He looks at the spaghetti noodles. Perplexed, Bruno lays them out in a line and thinks. "I just need some way to join these together..."</p>
            <p>Suddenly, he remembers his clothing iron. "Using this, I can easily join several spaghetti noodles into a single lasagna noodle." He's sharp like that.</p>
            <img src="img/iron.png" style="width: 50rem" />
            <p>Bruno notices how spaghetti noodles are transformed under the iron into one large noodle. Every spaghetti noodle maps to exactly one lasagna noodle, and every lasagna noodle is mapped to by more than one spaghetti noodle.</p>
            <p>"I wonder," he muses, "if this iron is injective or surjective?"</p>
            <p>For some reason, he won't go on until he answers this. Try and help him out:</p>

            <p><a href="injective.html">The iron is injective</a></p>
            <p><a href="surjective.html">The iron is surjective</a></p>
