            <p>"First," Bruno thinks to himself, I need to take care of these noodles. He looks at the spaghetti noodles. Perplexed, Bruno lays them out in a line and thinks. "I just need some way to join these together..."</p>
            <p>Suddenly, he remembers his clothing iron. "Using this, I can easily join several spaghetti noodles into a single lasagna noodle." He's sharp like that.</p>
            <img src="img/iron.png" style="width: 50rem" />
            <p>Bruno notices how spaghetti elements are transformed into one large noodle.</p>
            <p>"I wonder," he muses, "if this iron is injective or surjective?"</p>
            <p>For some reason, he won't go on until he answers this. Try and help him out:</p>
