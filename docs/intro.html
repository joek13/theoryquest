            <p>After a long, arduous day of waiting for his Busy Beaver machine to terminate, our hero Bruno L. is famished. His mind turns suddenly to his mother's world-famous Regular Language Lasagna. "Mmmmm," he thinks. "I sure could go for some of that right now."</p>
            <p>He pulls out his mother's dog-eared book of recipes and flips to page 3102. (His mother was an inventive cook.)</p>
            <div class="recipe">
